# Timer

## Overview
The timer app allows users to set custom durations by selecting hours, minutes, and seconds using a picker. Users can also add a label to each timer. Once started, the app displays a progress ring that visually represents the remaining time. Users have the options to pause, resume, or cancel the timer as needed.
